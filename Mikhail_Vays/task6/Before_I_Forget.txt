Go

Stapled shut, inside an outside world and I'm
Sealed in tight, bizarre but right at home
Claustrophobic, closing in and I'm
Catastrophic, not again
I'm smeared across the page and doused in gasoline
I wear you like a stain, yet I'm the one who's obscene
Catch me up on all your sordid little insurrections
I've got no time to lose, I'm just caught up in all the cattle

Fray the strings, throw the shapes
Hold your breath, listen

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that
